# DevExtreme jQuery TreeView - Getting Started 

This repository stores code examples of the jQuery TreeView component for the [Getting Started with TreeView](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/TreeView/Getting_Started_with_TreeView/) tutorial. The TreeView component displays a tree of text nodes from a local or remote source. This tutorial shows how to add the TreeView to a page, bind it to data, and configure its core features.

## Installation

Download the example and use NPM to install required libraries.

```
npm install
```

## Development server

Run `npx http-server -c-1` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
